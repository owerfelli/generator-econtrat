### What is [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)?

Yeoman is a command line tool that helps you to automate coding tasks. Out of the box, Yeoman 
doesn't do very much. It relies on a library of thousands of
[generators](http://yeoman.io/generators/) to actually perform the coding tasks for you.

Yeoman lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. Assuming you have a recent
version of [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) installed, you can use the following command
to install Yeoman.

```bash
npm install -g yo
```
